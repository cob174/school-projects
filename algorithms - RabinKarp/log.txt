Development/operation
This software was developed as version of the Rabin-Karp Algorithm utilizing both vegas
and Monte Carlo rules. When searching for a matching pattern, if the vegas rules is specified,
the software will verify the potential pattern match before returning an index in the string.
Probability was designed to take the subtract the potential for error from 1.0 to calculate 
the probability of success but, working with long doubles is a finicky task and wouldn't work.

Testing
Testing was performed by performing a variety of test utilizing varying lengths and characters
for both strings and patterns.

Generalizations
Instead of hashing for the ascii value of a single character, non-ascii alphabets still have 
unique identifiers for each of their characters, these characters could then be numerically
organized and used to hash. To accommodate larger search spaces, the prime value used for hashing
would have to be increased to an appropriately sized prime number.
